# Yarn-builder

This image is intended to be used for building yarn-based Node projects. It comes preinstalled with Node.js, yarn and git.
Moreover, the yarn cache contains a few commonly used packages such as `webpack`, `typescript` and a series of loaders to
speed up the `yarn install` process.

The image is available on Docker Hub at: https://hub.docker.com/r/troeggla/yarn-builder
